Study Helper App
Welcome to my Study Helper App. A simple web app that helps users keep track of their daily goals, study sessions, and even a few motivational quotes along the way.
This project is all about productivity and positivity.  Whether you're planning your study hours or just want to stay motivated, this app has you covered.

Features
Daily Goals & Study Sessions
Users can:
Create new goals and sessions


Read/View their list of goals/sessions


Update/Edit them


Delete them when completed or no longer needed


Quotes
Users can:
Add motivational quotes


View them whenever they need a boost


Delete quotes if needed

What I Learned
One of the hardest parts was getting the edit feature to work properly. At first, it felt a bit confusing and frustrating, but once I got it working for the Daily Goals, everything else started to make more sense. It was like everything followed a pattern, once I figured out how to do it for one section, it became much easier to apply the same logic to the rest.
I also learned how to set up the Edit and Delete functions using Go, which was a really valuable experience. Building this app helped me understand how CRUD operations can be reused across different features, and that made the development process smoother and more enjoyable.

Future Plans
Here are a few things Iâ€™m planning to add:
User login and account creation, so users can have their own goals, sessions, and quotes


Implement filtering and search for easier navigation


Improve UI and accessibility for a smoother experience
