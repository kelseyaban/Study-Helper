# Study Helper App
Welcome to my Study Helper App. A simple web app that helps users keep track of their daily goals, study sessions, and even a few motivational quotes along the way.
This project is all about productivity and positivity.  Whether you're planning your study hours or just want to stay motivated, this app has you covered.

## Features

### Daily Goals & Study Sessions
#### Users can:
- **Create** new goals and sessions
- **Read/View** their list of goals and sessions
- **Update/Edit** them
- **Delete** them when completed or no longer needed

### Quotes
#### Users can:
- **Add** motivational quotes
- **View** them whenever they need a boost
- **Delete** quotes if needed

## What I Learned
One of the hardest parts was getting the edit feature to work properly. At first, it felt a bit confusing and frustrating, but once I got it working for the Daily Goals, everything else started to make more sense. It was like everything followed a pattern, once I figured out how to do it for one section, it became much easier to apply the same logic to the rest.
I also learned how to set up the Edit and Delete functions using Go, which was a really valuable experience. Building this app helped me understand how CRUD operations can be reused across different features, and that made the development process smoother and more enjoyable.

## Future Plans:
- **User login and account creation** 
- **Search and filtering options** for better navigation
- **UI/UX Improvements** to enhance the user experience
